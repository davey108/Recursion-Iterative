# Recursion-Iterative
This project contains some fun functions (some involves Divide & Conquer Algorithm) to work with using Recursions and Iteratives methods

# Files Details:
- *IterationCode.java* - This class contains methods that deal with various sorting and algorithms that uses iterative approach to solve them
- *RecursionCode.java* - This class contains methods that deal with various sorting algorithms that uses recursion approach to solve them
- *RecursionCodeSampleTests.java* - This class contains test methods for *RecursionCode.java* and make sure those codes actually use recursions in them.
- *Project4Tests.java* - Extensive 100 test cases to throughly test both *IterationCode.java* and *RecursionCode.java*.
 # How to Run:
 1. Download files from this repository
 2. Run the test files or you can make a main class and run these methods from *IterationCode.java* and *RecursionCode.java* separately.
